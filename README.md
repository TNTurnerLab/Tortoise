# dnv_workflow_cpu

Maintainer:  Jeffrey Ng

Work in progress!

Uses only CPU based programs to call de novo variants

Testing progress:
Docker -> builds

Workflow -> Finish running, fixed errors. 

GPU comparison -> High levels of overlap with GPU output

Larger scale test -> Run on 3 more trios, with similar high levels of overlap

Resource/run time optimization -> GATK thread optimization
